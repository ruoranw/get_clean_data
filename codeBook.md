All data are generated from the UCI HAR Dataset folder. So all the varibles are the same as how it described in README.txt in the dataset folder unless the varible has recorded as changed here.

How table is generated and steps to slove each problem are all recored in the run_analysis.R file.

In Task 1, in the generated table, <i>label</i> means activity label(1-6). The original data comes from  activity_labels.txt file. The <i>subject</i> variable is the volunteers lables ranging from 1 to 30.

Varibles haven't change through Task 1 to Task 4.

In Task 5, in the generated table, all varibles except <i>subject</i> and <i>activities</i> are means of each varible and each subject. In this task, summarize function has been used to calculate each varible of each subject.
